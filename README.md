# GhostManSec
GhostManSec, or GMS Sploit, is a powerful tool with 8 diverse functions. Firstly, it has the ability to create a Backdoor, allowing users to remotely access a system with ease. Next, GMS Sploit can perform layer7 DDoS attacks, overloading the target server by attacking web applications.

> Additionally, this tool also supports layer4 DDoS attacks, causing network overload and disrupting services on the server. GMS Sploit can also check if the target is vulnerable to SQLi (SQL Injection), a common security loophole in web applications. It can also check for XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities, another loophole that allows attackers to inject malicious code into a website.

> The tool provides a feature to test the admin login page (Page Login Admin), helping users detect security vulnerabilities in the login system. GMS Sploit also supports checking the ports of a server, helping to determine open and closed ports on the system.

> Lastly, this tool allows for the exploitation of SQLi security vulnerabilities and gathering information from the database. This helps users identify security loopholes and gather important information from the target system.

In summary, GhostManSec or GMS Sploit is a powerful multi-functional tool designed to test and exploit common security vulnerabilities in web applications and server systems.
